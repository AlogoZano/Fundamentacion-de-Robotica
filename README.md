# Robotics Foundations

Throughout this course, an embedded control loop system was designed in order to control the speed of a motor given a specified reference. The challenge was implemented using ROS2 and it is the foundations for future robotics development.

## General requirements
* Computer with Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS Humble
* Basic knowledge of Ubuntu
* Basic understanding of control systems and ROS2
* Access to the following materials:
  * ESP32-WROOM
  * Motor with hall effect encoder
  * H-Bridge
  * Breadboard
  * LEDs
  * 220/330 ohm resistors
